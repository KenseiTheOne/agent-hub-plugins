## Event keys for plugins

A rule is chosen by the key without the plugin id: an exact name/alias, or a name plus an instance suffix after `:`,
`.`, `/`, `-` (`session-waiting:<sessionId>`, `build-blocked:<what>`). The message text is the title of the output
line that carries `event=` (up to 160 characters, no control characters); the subtitle is the plugin name plus the
rule label ("Mail · message not sent"): a leading "<plugin name>:" is cut from the label, and if the detail already says
the same (≥ 60 % of the label's significant words), the subtitle is only the name ("Quota" · "At this pace 85% will be
reached Sun 08.11 12:36 — before the reset"). With no detail, the label becomes the body. **The title of such a line
must contain metadata only**: a task name, a tab, a reason; no conversation text, no `tool_input`, no paths to secrets.

**A plugin's own rules.** A plugin declares rules for its own keys with a tag in its metadata:

```
# <agenthub.push key="build-blocked" hold="evening" cooldown="0s" kind="plugin">Сборка не запустится</agenthub.push>
# <agenthub.push key="crashed" quiet="true" kind="plugin">Упало</agenthub.push>
# <agenthub.push key="service-silent" away="5m" kind="plugin" was="runs">Молчит</agenthub.push>
# <agenthub.push key="service-silent" lang="en">Silent</agenthub.push>
```

`hold="evening"`, `quiet="true"` (urgent: shown right away during quiet hours too, not held for the digest),
`cooldown=<interval>`, `away=<interval>` (at the Mac — right away; away — the banner waits until the human is back or the
event stays raised that long), `macOnly="true"` (accepted from older plugins and ignored: banners are the only channel),
`kind=<kind>` (the switch in
"Settings": a shared core kind `sessions`, `updates`, `problems`, `other`; `plugin` — **the plugin's own toggle** (a
line with the plugin name in "Settings → Notifications"); `security` — a security exception, cannot be turned off; an
unknown value is a parse warning and the rule is dropped), `was=runs|night` (only with `kind="plugin"`: the former
contract 1 kind — if the user turned it off, it turns this toggle off, see "Migration" below); the tag text is the label
(up to 80 characters). The deprecated `kind="runs"` and `kind="night"` (contract 1) are accepted as
`kind="plugin" was="<kind>"`, and the linter warns. The service takes such rules **only from built-in, official and
own** plugins (`trusted`: the tier comes from the signed registry index or from the human's consent to an own plugin
from a folder — [`docs/plugins-registry.md`](../../../docs/plugins-registry.md), "Own sources"); they go ahead of the
shared table. Other plugins' tags are ignored. This way the core knows no plugin's keys: official plugins' rules live in
their metadata (registry `agent-hub-plugins`), own plugins' rules in their metadata in the tool's repository; built-in
plugins (`agents`, `claude-sessions`) declare theirs the same way. For an own plugin, rules with `kind="security"` and
`quiet="true"` are `push` permissions: they are shown in the consent window, and their appearance is a permission
increase (not a silent update from the folder).

The shared table (`rules.mjs`) contains only the core's shared keys (since contract 2 it no longer has `blocker`,
`session-died`, `workflow-failed`, `workflow-orphaned` or the quota keys: the plugins that need them declare them —
`claude-sessions` (`died`), `agents` (`wf-failed`, `wf-orphaned`), `quota` (`week-80` and `pace-85` — at most once a
week, `token-lost` — immediately; all of them "failures and warnings")):

| Key | When it is sent |
|---|---|
| `session-waiting` (`waiting:<sessionId>` in claude-sessions) | at the Mac — a banner immediately; away — once the human is back or after 5 min, whichever comes first (during quiet hours — the digest); no flap window |
| `auth-failed` | immediately |
| `source-broken`, `plugin-error` | once until recovery |
| `approvals-paused` (source `@hub`) | immediately |
| `app-pin-changed` (source `@hub`) | immediately and during quiet hours, on every change of `requirements.app` (no flap window); at the Mac — always `osascript`, without `push.notify` and `/push/ack` (`bannerAlways`); the text says where the pin came from (`из Claude Code` — capitalized at the start) |
| `app-pin-path-changed` (source `@hub`) | immediately and during quiet hours, on every change of `appPin.path` with the same requirement (the bundle the daemon launches); at the Mac — always `osascript` (`bannerAlways`); "The path of the pinned Agent Hub build changed — the daemon now launches <path>. If it wasn't you, open the journal" |
| `plugin-update:<id>:<version>` (source `@hub`) | a new version of an installed plugin in the signed catalog, once per version ("Update available: Mail 0.4.0") |
| `plugin-own-updated:<id>:<version>` (source `@hub`) | an own plugin was updated from its folder automatically (same permissions, no consent window): "Plugin updated — "Mail" updated to 0.4.0" (or "updated from its folder (version …)" when the version stayed); every such update, no flap window; kind `updates` |
| `app-restart-stopped` (source `@hub`) | immediately, once per episode of the supervisor stopping (app service: the app crashed 3 times in 10 min or 3 checks in a row could not launch it — `why`); again only after the app has opened the event stream and the stop is cleared; at the Mac — always `osascript` (`bannerAlways`: there is no app to acknowledge); "Agent Hub keeps crashing — restarts stopped: 3 restarts in 10 min. Open Agent Hub yourself; details — agenthub logs" (with `why` — "Cannot launch Agent Hub (<why>)…") |
| anything else | immediately, labeled "Event "key"" |

In general: while a key is raised there is one message; cleared and raised again within 10 min after sending — it is
suppressed (flapping). Events of **third-party** plugins (`trusted: false`) arrive without their text and without their
rules.

Limits (protecting the daemon from an event flood): at most `maxPerPluginPerMin` (20) new notifications per minute from
one trusted plugin and `maxPerUntrustedPerMin` (5) from a third-party one; the first one over the limit produces a
single notification "notifications from the plugin are muted for a minute" (`push-throttled` in the journal), the
other events are only remembered. Entries (keys) per plugin — at most `maxEntriesPerPlugin` (500) /
`maxEntriesPerUntrusted` (100): beyond that the longest-cleared ones are evicted, and if all are raised the new key is
not remembered (`push-dropped`: the first refusal in a minute is recorded immediately, the rest as one `push-dropped`
summary with `dropped: N` when the minute ends). Hub events (`@hub`) have no such limits. `push-state.json` is written
once per batch of events (when the queue is empty, at least every 2 s); the queue yields the event loop between
operations.

## Switches — "Settings → Notifications" (2026-11-09)

Stored in `<home>/settings.json → notifications` (`{enabled, kinds: {<kind>: bool}, quiet: {enabled, start, end} | null}`),
written only by the app class (the pinned build) via `PUT /settings/notifications`
([`docs/api.md`](../../../docs/api.md)); the service picks up changes on `settings.changed` without a restart.

| Kind | Core rules | Plugins (`kind=` in the tag) |
|---|---|---|
| `sessions` — waiting for an answer / session questions | `session-waiting`, `approvals-paused` | — |
| `updates` — hub and plugin updates | `plugin-update`, `plugin-own-updated`, `hub-update`, `hub-update-ready`, `hub-update-installed`, `hub-update-failed` | — |
| `problems` — plugin failures and warnings | `source-broken`, `plugin-error`, `auth-failed` (and plugin rules with `kind="problems"`, for example quota) | a rule with `kind="problems"` or a key from the table (`auth-failed`) |
| `other` — everything else from plugins | a key without a rule; **all** events of third-party plugins | a rule without `kind` and without a match in the table |
| `plugin:<id>` — **the plugin's own toggle** | — | rules with `kind="plugin"` (and the deprecated `kind="runs"`/`"night"`): a line in "Settings" with the plugin name, only while the plugin is installed |
| `security` — **cannot be turned off** | `app-pin-changed`, `app-pin-path-changed`, `app-restart-stopped`, `hub-update-tag-moved`, `hub-update-suspect` | rules with `kind="security"` (tampering signals) |

**The plugin's own toggle** (contract 2). `settings.json → pluginNotifications.plugins` holds `{<id>: bool}`;
`/state.notifications.plugins` has lines `{id, title, on, labels, legacy?}` for installed trusted plugins that have a
`kind="plugin"` rule. The title is in the hub language (from `<agenthub.title lang=…>`), `labels` are the labels of its
rules. No plugin — no line; the value in `settings.json` stays (if the plugin comes back, the same choice applies).
The master switch also silences plugin toggles; they do not affect `security`.

**Migrating contract 1 settings.** Before 2026-11-09 `settings.json` had the kinds `runs` ("Agent runs") and `night`.
The core no longer knows them, but the user's choice is not lost:

1. Turned-off `kinds.runs/night = false` stay in `settings.json → notifications.kinds` as they are — the core sees
   them as "a former kind is off" (`legacy` in memory); `true` means nothing (it is on by default anyway).
2. A plugin toggle without an explicit value is off if at least one of its rules declared a turned-off former kind:
   `kind="night"`/`kind="runs"` (deprecated synonym) or `kind="plugin" was="night"|"runs"`. The built-in `agents` and
   `claude-sessions` declare `was="runs"` — before 2026-11-09 their events used the "Agent runs" kind.
3. As soon as the core sees such a plugin, it fixes the inferred value as an explicit `plugins.<id> = false` with a
   `migrated.<id>` mark (journal `settings-migrated {plugin, from}`, event `settings.changed`): from then on the plugin
   may change `kind="night"` to `kind="plugin"` without `was=` and the choice is kept. Migration never touches an
   explicit human choice; a line inferred from migration has `legacy: true` ("Turned off by an earlier notification
   setting") until the human touches it.
4. **Once only.** After the first full plugin scan (`host.start` → `core.pluginsScanned`) the core records which plugins
   the migration applies to (`pluginNotifications.legacyFor` — ids of the plugins installed at that time; journal
   `settings-migrated {legacyFor}`). A plugin installed later is not turned off by the old setting, even if it declares
   `was=`.
5. `PUT /settings/notifications` with `kinds.runs|night` — `400 args:kinds:enum`; a digest item from a pre-migration
   file with kind `runs`/`night` counts as "other".

**A hub rollback** (`agenthub hub rollback` to a contract 1 core) keeps the choice: in `settings.json` the turned-off
`runs`/`night` live in `notifications.kinds`, where the old core reads them (its "Runs" and "Night" stay silent), and
the plugin toggles and migration marks live in a separate top-level key `pluginNotifications {plugins, migrated,
legacyFor}`: the old core does not normalize it and keeps it as is when it writes `settings.json`. After updating again
the choice is in place. If the human turned a former kind back on in the old hub, the new core drops the "off" values
inferred from it (`migrated`), while explicit choices stay.

The kind of a plugin rule without `kind` is the kind of the shared-table rule with the same key (`auth-failed` →
`problems`), otherwise `other`. Only the core and a trusted plugin set kinds; `services.push.rules` in `config.json`
does not change the kind, and a third-party plugin cannot declare `security` (its rules are not taken at all). The
`security` kind from the core table applies only to the hub's own events (`@hub`): a plugin that raises a core key
(`app-restart-stopped` and the like) gets a rule without a kind, without `bannerAlways`, `quietException` and the hub
label — a trusted plugin declares a security exception only with its own `<agenthub.push kind="security">` tag (the
registry linter warns about such a tag and about core keys).

**`config.json` does not override security exceptions**: `services.push.rules` is not applied to rules of kind
`security` (core or trusted plugins) — no `hold`, no `awayDelayMs`, no `cooldownMs`, no `label`, no new alias that
hijacks a core key. The only way to silence them is to turn off the whole service (`services.push.enabled = false`),
and "Settings → Notifications" warns about that.

- **A turned-off kind goes nowhere**: no `push.notify` to the shell, no fallback `osascript`, no digest item; the journal gets `push-muted {key, rule, kind, reason: "kind"|"all"}` without text. The event stays in the
  plugin state (popover, plugin page) and in the journal. Raising it does not consume the plugin rate limit and does not
  produce "notifications muted".
- The decision is made when the event is raised and before every deferred send: the evening blocker waited for 21:00, a
  waiting session for idleness, an item for the morning digest (`push-muted {key: "digest", count}`). Off at send time —
  not sent; turned off while waiting but on again by send time — sent as usual (`push-muted` once per "off"). Raised
  while the kind was off — not re-sent after it is turned on (the next state will arrive). A digest item without `kind`
  (a file from before 2026-11-09) gets its kind from the key.
- The master switch (`enabled: false`) silences all kinds except `security`.
- **Why `security` cannot be turned off**: these are signals of possible tampering (the app re-pinned, the build path
  changed, a release tag moved, a tampering signal declared by a plugin) and of app restarts being stopped. Settings are
  changed by the app class — that is, by the very build the pin notification is about; a switch for such events would be
  the first thing a swapped build flips. So they are neither under the master switch nor among the kinds (`PUT` with
  `kinds.security` — `400 args:kinds:enum`), and the banner for hub events still bypasses the shell (`bannerAlways`).
- **Quiet hours** — `quiet` in settings; until it is set, `services.push.quietStart/quietEnd` from `config.json` apply
  (as before 2026-11-09), and without them 23:00–08:00 (`/state.notifications.quiet.from`: `settings` | `config` |
  `default`). The first edit in "Settings" starts from the effective values. `quiet.enabled: false` — at night everything
  takes the normal route (a banner immediately, no digest); the evening blocker and the "night day" are computed from the
  same bounds. `quietStart == quietEnd` in `config.json` (formerly "no quiet hours") is shown as quiet hours turned off
  with bounds 23:00–08:00. The blocker's evening window runs from `eveningAt` to the start of quiet hours, only if that
  is in the evening (no longer than 12 h): quiet hours from 20:00 with `eveningAt` 21:00 give no window, and the blocker
  waits for the night to start.
